# Learning Python

Building a solid Python foundation through small, practical scripts, with a focus on clean and reusable patterns.

This repository is for **learners** who want to understand how Python actually works under the hood — not just write code that “works.”

### Current focus
Lately, I’ve been revisiting the basics to deepen my understanding of how Python really works:

- The "self" and memory in OOP: understanding how instance variables and classes relate in memory (verifying identity with id())
- Iterators and the iterator protocol
- How `for` loops work internally

These topics often confuse beginners (they definitely confused me), so the examples here start from first principles and build up gradually.
