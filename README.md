# Learning Python

Building a solid Python foundation through small, practical scripts,
with a focus on clean and reusable patterns.

This repository is not about writing “better” Python,
but about understanding how Python actually works under the hood.

## Current focus

Lately, I’ve been revisiting the basics to deepen my understanding of:

- Iterators and the iterator protocol
- How `for` loops work internally

Most of the code here consists of small experiments and notes
created while exploring these concepts step by step.
